## 🎨🖌️  Create Solution Sign

The **create_solution_sign** function generates a unique sign for each solution name, ensuring distinct visual representation for every solution.

**Automated sign painting** utilizes computerized systems to create signage with precision and efficiency. These systems can generate signs of any font size or color, allowing for versatility in design. By leveraging automated processes, businesses can produce signage quickly and accurately, saving time and resources. Additionally, the signs are typically saved as .PNG files, ensuring compatibility across various platforms and ease of distribution. This approach streamlines the sign-making process, resulting in high-quality output while minimizing manual labor and errors.

**Matplotlib** is a powerful Python library for creating static, interactive, and animated **visualizations**. It offers a wide range of plotting functionalities, enabling users to generate high-quality graphs, charts, and plots for data analysis and presentation purposes.

## Create Sign Library Functions

Help on module create_sign:

NAME
    create_sign

FUNCTIONS
    create_sign(word, font_size=100, font_color='lime', background_color='black', glow_color='lime')

    create_sign_II(word: str, font_size: int = 120, font_color: str = 'lime', background_color: str = 'black', glow_color: str = 'lime', glow_width: int = 6, pad_px: int = 40, font_path: str | None = None, dpi: int = 200, save_path: str | None = None)
        Render a glowing text 'sign' and optionally save to file.

        Returns:
            (fig, ax) if not saved, else the save_path.

    create_solution_sign(df)

    create_stacked_sign(phrase, font_size=100, font_color='lime', background_color='black', glow_color='lime')
        Split the phrase into individual words

    persist_plt(plt, filename)
